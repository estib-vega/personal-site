# Personal site

This is the code of my personal site, currently available in [here](https://estib-vega.vercel.app)

The project is built on Next.JS and it's being used mostly as a playground and place to show some of my other projects

## Environment variables

The project requires some variables to be set in the environment:

Comma-separated list of allow-listed emails

```sh
ALLOWLISTED_USER_EMAILS
```

Comma-separated list of admin emails
```sh
ADMIN_USER_EMAILS
```
DB authentication
```sh
SECRET
DATABASE_URL
```
Authorization callback URL
